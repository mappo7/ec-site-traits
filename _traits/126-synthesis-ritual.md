## Synthesis Ritual

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

**Community Trait proposed by:** @PipsquEECS

On the Ether Cards Explorer, you can view the entire set of original Ether Cards in a grid. With Synthesis ritual, you can **select layers from any adjacent cardâ€™s accidental collaboration artwork and copy them onto the layers on your card**. This does not affect the card(s) from which you copy the layer(s), but replaces the layer(s) on your card with the selected layer(s).

*Terms and conditions apply.
