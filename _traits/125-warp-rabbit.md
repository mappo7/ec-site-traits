## Warp Rabbit

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

**Community Trait proposed by:** @PipsquEECS *(Inspired by @bitsikka)*

Warp Rabbit is an experiment in randomization. **Every time Warp Rabbit is used, it jumps to a different card and takes on a new shape**. Warp Rabbit might emerge with Randomized Edition Trait benefits, it might drop Dust onto a card, or it might be a portal for an artwork airdrop. Maybe it will drop an “arsonist” Trait onto your card if you use the Forge. Maybe it will hang out on your card for a while and simply leap away.

*Terms and conditions apply.
