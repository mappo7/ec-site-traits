## Reforge

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

Deep in the dark bowels of Mount Ether Cards, there lies a room that rings with the clash of metal and rock. Billowing heat from its heart like a living dragon, the Forge can be an unforgiving place – unless you have this Trait to serve as your shield.

The Forge is one of Ether Cards’ utility developments for NFTs. It enables Cards as well as traits to be combined and reconfigured. The Forge can initially be used to rearrange or combine layer art from multiple cards. In order to use the Forge, you would need to burn one of your cards – but this trait gives you the ability to **use the Forge’s function once without sacrificing a card to the Forge. Compared with the Reforge Trait, this Trait also guarantees that your new layers will be non-common layers.**
