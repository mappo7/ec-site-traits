**Community Trait proposed by:** @SaArbitrage

Ether Cards are indeed like a flock of birds who lay golden eggs. They fly through the skies of the entire cryptosphere, connecting to a network of benefits that grows with each partner project. With the Golden Goose Trait, your card becomes one of the most rare birds of all, since there are only 25 of these. With the Golden Goose Trait, **you get a Blind Bag for free every time EtherCards holds a Blind Bag event on the events platform**. 

*Terms and conditions apply.
